lets build a website using react that will be a tool to help learn arabic. I will give a story that will be both in arabic and english. I want the app to show the arabic version but if someone clicks on a word it shows the english definition or phrase that corresponds to the word. This will help users learn to read and when they get to a word they dont know they can quickly click on the word to see the meaning and continue reading. lets also leave words that have been clicked highlighted and added to a list in a pannel next to the story so that the user can go through and see the words that they did not know. I have added a few files with stories in arabic and english to use for the app. So probably you will have to find some way to map the arabic to the english. I want all the memory for the map to be build in so no need for api or retrieving translations from elswhere.

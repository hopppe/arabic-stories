  - Edge functions for improved global performance

## Components Structure
- `Layout.tsx` - Main layout wrapper with navigation and responsive container
- `Navigation.tsx` - Main navigation component with authentication state awareness
- `StoryView.tsx` - Displays individual stories with translations and interactive elements
- `StoryList.tsx` - Displays list of available stories with filtering and sorting
- `UserStoryList.tsx` - Shows stories created by the current user with CRUD operations
- `ArabicText.tsx` - Handles Arabic text display with interactive translations and vowelization
- `TranslationPopup.tsx` - Shows word translations on hover/click with additional context
- `LearnedWords.tsx` - Tracks and displays vocabulary learned by users with progress indicators
- `StoryReader.tsx` - Core reading experience component with word-highlighting and progress tracking
- `ConnectionRecovery.tsx` - Handles connection issues with Supabase with automatic retry logic
- `StorySelector.tsx` - Allows users to browse and select stories by category/difficulty
- `LearnedWordsList.tsx` - Shows vocabulary statistics and learning progress

## Pages
- `/` - Homepage with introduction and featured stories
- `/login` - User authentication page with email/password and OAuth providers
- `/signup` - New user registration with validation
- `/about` - Information about the platform and learning methodology
- `/stories` - Browse all available stories with filtering
- `/stories/[id]` - Individual story view with reading interface
- `/stories/create` - Story creation page with AI generation options
- `/admin/*` - Admin-only pages for content management and user administration
- `/payment/*` - Subscription management pages with Stripe integration
- `/auth/callback` - OAuth callback handling

## API Routes
- `/api/generate-story` - Uses OpenAI to generate custom stories with specified parameters
- `/api/create-checkout-session` - Creates Stripe checkout sessions for subscription
- `/api/verify-payment` - Validates Stripe payment status
- `/api/bypass-payment` - Development-only endpoint for testing premium features

## Database Schema
- **users** - Supabase auth.users table with extended profile fields
  - id, email, created_at, last_sign_in
- **profiles** - User profile information
  - id (references users.id), display_name, has_paid, preferences
- **stories** - User-created stories
  - id, title, content, user_id, created_at, dialect, difficulty
- **word_mappings** - Custom word translations
  - story_id, arabic_word, english_translation
- **learned_words** - User vocabulary progress
  - user_id, word, translation, learned_at, review_count

## Authentication System
- Email/password authentication with secure password hashing
- Google OAuth integration with PKCE flow
- Session management with Supabase
- Premium content access control based on subscription status
- Connection recovery mechanism for handling token expiration
- Security headers and XSS protection

## Current Development Status
- Core story reading functionality implemented and tested
- Basic user authentication complete with session persistence
- Story creation workflow implemented with AI integration
- Word translation system working with hover/click interactions
- Vocabulary tracking partially implemented with word highlighting
- Mobile responsiveness implemented but needs refinement on small screens
- Stripe integration complete for subscription management
- OpenAI integration working for custom story generation

## Implementation Challenges
- **RTL Text Handling**: Proper rendering of Arabic text with correct punctuation
- **Word Tokenization**: Accurate splitting of Arabic text into meaningful units
- **Connection Recovery**: Handling Supabase connection drops gracefully
- **AI Prompt Engineering**: Creating effective prompts for consistent story generation
- **Translation Accuracy**: Ensuring word translations are contextually appropriate
- **Session Management**: Proper handling of auth state across page navigations
- **Mobile Interactions**: Making word selection work well on touch devices

## Recent Achievements
- Implemented word-by-word translation system with context awareness
- Added vocabulary learning tracking with progress visualization
- Created interactive story reader with custom highlighting
- Built robust authentication flow with Supabase with error recovery
- Setup story creation interface with AI-powered generation
- Integrated Stripe payment flow for subscription management
- Improved RTL text rendering and interaction

## Known Issues
- Connection reliability with Supabase occasionally fails during extended sessions
- Mobile responsiveness on small screens (<320px) needs improvement
- Word translations sometimes contain inaccuracies for dialectal Arabic
- Performance optimization needed for story loading with many translations
- OAuth redirect occasionally fails in certain browser configurations
- Story generation can be slow during peak API usage times
- CSS modules sometimes cause hydration mismatches with SSR

## Next Steps
- Improve vocabulary tracking analytics with spaced repetition algorithm
- Add user progress dashboards with learning statistics
- Implement audio pronunciation features for vocabulary practice
- Enhance mobile experience with better touch interactions
- Add more diverse story content across different difficulty levels
- Implement caching strategy for improved performance
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Implement offline reading capabilities with PWA features
- Create comprehensive test suite for critical components

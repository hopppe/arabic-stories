The Lost Phone
Sara was walking in the mall when she noticed her phone was missing. She looked around and asked a security guard for help. A kind man had already found it and turned it in. Sara smiled and thanked him.

الجوال الضايع
سارة كانت تمشي في المول ولحظت إن جوالها مو معاها. دورت حواليها وسألت رجل الأمن يساعدها. رجال طيب كان لاقيه وسلّمه. سارة ابتسمت وشكرته.
